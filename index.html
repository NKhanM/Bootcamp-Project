    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Bouncing Ball Games</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). I have tried to creat a bouncing ball games. This project demonstrates a 
  comprehensive understanding of the use of arrays, variables, randomness and loops. 
  I created a Bouncing Ball Games. In my project, I have started with creating a special ball 
  with specific size and colour. I have also used other some random ball with random sizes and colours.
  Everytime, the special ball touches the random balls, they turn into special ball's colour
  and I have also added a score variable. When the special ball touches the other balls, I will get one point, thus my score is going up.
  I have also added a timer on the screen so that I can monitor my score everytime I run the sketch.
